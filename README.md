# INTEGRATION
Sometimes we get integrations which are too difficult or they require much calculations. Or sometimes we become too lazy to solve simple integrations. Whatever might be the reasons, now, you don't need to solve any of them. U get your answer through this program. Run and input the function of 'x' putting the limits and you get the answer (and that also for free - no internet, no calculators) .
This finds out the approximate value of the integration for you.
# Bibliograpy
This code uses the open source code from github 'tinyexpr' which is a header file for C. It takes care of the expression tree and u do not need to worry much about it.

has helped to see the syntax of conversion of data types.
# Things you can do with this CODE
You can fork to remove all the limitations and be an open source contributer.
You can use this code to build a better program. 
# Limitations
It cannot perform indefinite integrations. Only definite integrations are allowed.
It cannot detect invalid inputs.
It cannot provide you with exact values other than linear functions.
